The film also features elements of intimate dialogue, original choreography and spoken word by Young, and behind the scenes footage inspired by making of the film, which went on to win Critics' Pick at the Tampa Bay Art and Film Festival in 2023.",

We all want to be happy - but what is happiness and why is it so elusive? Positive psycho-therapist Marie McLeod takes on a group of volunteers with mental health issues and offers them interventions grounded in positive psychology, neuroscience and wellbeing science. The film's premise is; if we offer the science of happiness to people experiencing struggle; what difference would it make? Is happiness a learnable skill and can we teach people skills to live happier, healthier and more meaningful lives? The world of psychology has for far too long studied what goes wrong with the human mind. Whilst these have led to important understandings about our deficits and disorders - there is another side of those sciences. The science of what is right about us and what thoughts, actions, and behaviours we can all learn that make life worth living. With unprecedented access; the result is an intimate, heartfelt and hopeful film that offers a rare glimpse into the lives of 7 people who make incredible transforms as a result of learning 'How to Thrive?'",

Traveling into a fictional television show, the story of immigration, war, acceptance, and the magic of Christmas is told through intertwining moments on the day of Mr. Ronald Brown's Christmas Posada. With civil unrest and a march for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), the community has decided that it is too dangerous to have their annual Posada procession. Mr. Brown, knowing the importance of his family's tradition, comes up with the idea to host a Posada at his home. However, Mr. Brown believes, in the spirit of the ERA, it is time to invite ALL his friends in Trillberry to his backyard Posada. The day of the Posada will bring surprises, tears, and new life to a grieving and divided community.",

        "plot": "In Alberta, domestic abuse survivors consistently report that the legal system is one of the most significant barriers to their healing journeys. The legal system has not been designed for survivors. Survivors who access it must often navigate a minefield of judges and lawyers who do not understand the realities of domestic violence and that the legal procedures protect their abusers while exposing survivors to further harm. These experiences can be profoundly traumatizing and, in some cases, can reinforce or replicate the abuse survivors have already experienced. In 2023, the Alberta Council of Women's Shelters partnered with survivors from across Alberta to better understand the experience of navigating the legal system in cases of domestic violence and abuse. In this documentary, seven survivors share their experiences of the legal system and what they wish judges, lawyers, and the public knew about domestic abuse.",

Voices over the Water is a story about tragedy and opportunity, about loss and survival, irony and consequence. As Americans, we espouse the ideals of individualism and freedom. Among those seeking this \"Paradise on Earth,\" were people from the Highlands of Scotland. They spoke a different language and wore strange clothing. They had a hard choice: abandon those things that made them distinctive, or risk isolation and failure. Today when Scottish roots and culture are celebrated, a modern identity is front and center. A colorful, romantic image that may have originated in something far more sinister. Voices over the Water searches for what lies behind these celebrations and pageantry, uncovering tragedies, often unspoken and perhaps misunderstood. What can we learn about our identity as Americans by looking back into this rich history? Who can claim this history as their own? And who's choosing you?",
