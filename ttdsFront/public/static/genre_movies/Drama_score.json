Synopsis \"An American Posada\" is an homage to 1950-1960s television with a very special difference. Imagine if in the 50-60s the stories of diversity were told on TV. Traveling into a fictional television show, the story of immigration, war, acceptance, and the magic of Christmas is told through intertwining moments on the day of Mr. Ronald Brown's Christmas Posada. With civil unrest and a march for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), the community has decided that it is too dangerous to have their annual Posada procession. Mr. Brown, knowing the importance of his family's tradition, comes up with the idea to host a Posada at his home. However, Mr. Brown believes, in the spirit of the ERA, it is time to invite ALL his friends in Trillberry to his backyard Posada. The day of the Posada will bring surprises, tears, and new life to a grieving and divided community.",

But we should also know about those whose dreams have been shattered in the trials of life. That is when we become human. With such beautiful hope every parent waits for a baby. Think about the state of mind of such parents if a child is born with a mental or physical disability. The film is about the inner lives of many families with children with mental and physical conditions. The Rauf - Sajna couple (Vijayakumar - Priya Sreejith) started raising their second child (Russell) with great anticipation. But the child's illness at the age of five brings the family to tears. While passing the days in despair, Rauf - Sajna slowly begins to come to terms with reality when they hear a speech by Father Davis Chiramel at a regional gathering. Takes care of the baby as a challenge and lives for him. All of the painful and joyous experiences that this family faces from many, many times, go straight ahead together. Fazal (Maqbool Salman) who enters the family as a son-in-law as if for a reason, discovers the talent of the child and nurtures it through training and brings the child to a height. In the end, when the luck that a normal family can't even dream of reaches the family through that child, this movie becomes an inspiration for such families and a lot of messages for the society. Each and every scene in this movie is shot with a touch of comedy and is exciting for the audience.",
