But now, PAIRD drones are appearing around the world, attacking people and places for no apparent reason. So the authorities are hoping that he can help, if he can remember. Otherwise, he's going on trial for the destruction the drones have caused.

Their only lead is a series of enigmatic notes that set them off on an action-filled adventure around the world to find out who they are and just what the heck is going on.",

Camelia and Emilio, half-siblings and children of the feared drug lords Camelia La Texana and Emilio Varela, have lived parallel lives without knowing each other. Over the years, both have inherited the cunning and power of their parents, but have remained oblivious to the existence of the other. Camelia, with her cold and calculating style of command, has forged her empire in the drug business; while Emilio, a young man with an innate talent for strategy, has maintained his father's legacy in the shadows of violence and control. However, when a power conflict threatens to destabilize both, the paths of these two young people cross in a violent and inevitable way. In an environment where loyalty is bought with blood and enemies are always lurking, Camelia and Emilio will be forced to face not only the ghosts of their parents, but also the dark secrets they keep and that could destroy them. \"The Children of Camelia and Emilio\" is a story of revenge, power and loyalty in which family ties become a double-edged sword. Will they be able to overcome the shadows of the past and join forces, or will they fall like their parents, trapped in a cycle of endless violence?",

But when the turf war for absolute control of their territory reaches its peak, both men are dragged to a deadly crossroads, where family ties and friendship are put to the devastating test. Fernando, who has raised Andr\u00e9s' son with his ex-partner, faces a cruel revelation: to protect his family, he may be forced to betray his best friend and lifelong partner.

However, the real twist occurs when tragedy strikes: two of her closest friends are murdered as a direct result of her illegal activities. Devastated by the loss and consumed by guilt, Brie is forced to face the harsh reality of her choices. Instead of succumbing to the pain, she makes a radical decision: seek revenge.
