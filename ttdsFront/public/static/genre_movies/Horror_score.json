Her father hid her in their Castle and her mother dyed her hair in order to protect her. Unfortunately, the sunlight turned her dyed hair blue. Thus was born the myth of \"Azzurrina\". On 21 June 1375, the ball of rags that Azzurrina was playing with ended up in a mound of snow. With a bloodcurdling scream, she disappeared into thin air, without ever being found. Every five years since then, Guendalina makes her voice heard.",

The more energetically she tackles it, the more something sinister seems to spread from it. Is Mrs. Pospisil possibly no longer alone in her home? She would never ask her son for help; after all, she doesn't want to confirm his fears. The annoying janitor (Eva Maria Marold) also seems to be watching her constantly, just to be able to tell Patrick about a misstep. So Mrs. Pospisil will have to prove her independence one more time. And if it's the last thing she has to do - she has no intention of backing down .",

Evelyn learns that the legend of Harvey Carver is alive and well as the stories of his appearances spread throughout the paranormal community. Legend says that he will kill anyone who enters his Brookstown home, without permission. The Y-Town Ghost Hunters set up their trip and head out to explore these locations. The last stop on the map is \"The Carver House\". Once they arrive in Brookstown, the locals quickly make them feel very unwelcome. They learn from the local man \"Binks\" they must visit \"Pearl's Palm Readers\", which locals refer to as \"the Witch Shop\" if they are truly looking to summon the spirit of Harvey Carver. Upon arrival, the Ghost Hunters meet Pearl (Dawn Lori), Hazel (Wendy Lee Rounds) and Ivy (Julianna Mistovich), Witches Masquerading as Tarot Card readers. Pearl warns the Y-Town Ghost Hunters multiple times that awakening Harvey Carver is very dangerous and the coven does NOT recommend doing so. The group dismiss the warnings as just \"part of the witch's act\". Pearl warns them again that if Harvey Carver arrives, ALL HELL will break loose and if they wish to proceed, it's now AT THEIR OWN RISK.",

        "plot": "Robert Francis Garrow was a serial rapist and murderer whose reign of terror paralyzed the North Country between the years of 1960 and 1978. Born in Mineville, New York in 1936, Robert's childhood was an endless cycle of unimaginable horror. Beatings, sexual abuse, bestiality and bloodshed. As an adult, Robert would become a sadomasochist, rapist and serial killer. The exact number of his victims to this day remains uncertain. A knife wielding psychopath that could charm his victims before carving them to death. Robert was clever and cunning. He was able to manipulate the law, fake his own paralysis, escape from prison, and avoid capture for over a decade.",

However, Elodia's dormitory turns out to be very strict about the behavior of its students. They even put 100 mirrors in all the dormitory halls so that students who want to do bad things immediately cancel their intentions because they are embarrassed when they see themselves. The strictness of the rules creates pressure and a group of schoolgirls who enjoy playing a strange game using mirrors: the ritual of summoning the bloody mary with the new girls. The game, originally just a way to scare new students, turns into a disaster when a spirit appears trying to harm the students. Riani doll is considered to be the mastermind behind this disaster. Riana is trapped in a dilemma between bringing back the Riani doll or finding answers to the various terrors accused of the Riani doll.",
