The film depicts the lives of a tribal community residing deep in the dense forests of south India. They have been bestowed by an auspicious gift by the Almighty. The story-line has a series of events that lead up-to the Charan Pooja day, wherein the tribe offers prayers to the Gods to Protect the auspicious gift bestowed upon them by the Almighty himself, which would be lost. The film is a bundle of twists and turns, and how the lives of those involved are affected.",

Spread across 10,000 square kilometers in India and Bangaldesh and its sheer vastness of Sundarbans with water everywhere lined by mangroves evokes awe. There are 60 species of mangrove and mangrove associates in Sundarbans with each species flowering at a different time of the year. To make people experience this primordial landscape, we have created the one hour film \"Drifting in the Waters of Sundarbans\". Through this film, we take you on a one hour relaxing virtual boat ride through the mangroves of Sundarbans. You listen to the sounds of birds, soft sound of flowing water, wild blowing on the leaves of mangroves, crocodiles basking in the mud flats and then sliding into water, deer grazing peacefully and many more to relax. This film is aimed to give you a raw feel of being there in the heart of nature as we experience during our explorations. So there is no human voice to disturb you nor is there any composed music. All you hear are the natural sounds. You can even close your eyes and listen with headphones the soft sounds to relax your soul. Research studies have shown that Natural sounds improve health, increase positive affect, and lower stress and annoyance. Simply listening to natural sounds results in decrease in mortality rates and stress and improves mental health, cognitive performance and even birth outcomes. So listen as well as play it for your loved ones. Sundarbans is not only a place worthy of visit for clicking selfies. Sundarbans changes you without you knowing.",

In a dark and ruthless world, Tina will have to decide how far she is willing to go to avenge the deaths of the men she loved most, and if justice is really enough to heal the wounds of the soul.

Countless bottles have already thrown them into the Rhine, but never get an answer back to this album. Her adoptive Henning and Anni try to make her start into a new life as simple as possible, but still the girl often feels lonely in the strange environment. This is a special gift, because on closer inspection, Laini discovers numbers and strangely sounding words on the pages. What do they mean? Are they encrypted messages from their parents? Together with her new friends Paul and Michael she tries to solve the riddle and goes on a journey of discovery through Wiesbaden and into her own past. Die Flaschenpostinsel is a film about three children, each of them looking for their personal definition of home and family. In a variety of ways, they find each other and unite their abilities to interpret the indications on the way to the bottle depot. They recognize that the path is often more important than the goal and grow beyond the expectations of their parents and themselves.",

Within the ranks of The Skoners, the scent of mutiny permeates the air when Tank-an animalistic killer, bent on achieving honor through blood-moves to overthrow the current leadership run by the wise and calculated Gauge, and undermine years of Gauge's endeavors to implement a new society in the western territory, where all can ride hard and live free.",
