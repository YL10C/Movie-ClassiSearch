As fear grips the town, a group of film students, led by the virginal protagonist Cameron (Jake Leahy), find themselves at the center of the madness. With their eccentric teacher Oscar (Robert Jerome Pagan) - a washed-up filmmaker with a colorful past - by their side, Cameron and his tight-knit friends must navigate a landscape of absurdity and danger as they confront the unhinged killer terrorizing their community. As the body count rises, Cameron is forced to confront his own identity and desires, grappling with the question of \"who's my daddy\" amidst the chaos. With crude humor, irreverent wit, and no shortage of outrageous antics, Trillberry Murders is a raunchy, politically incorrect comedy that pushes boundaries and leaves audiences gasping for air between laughs. Will they outsmart the killer, or will Mophet's rampage put an end to Trillberry's twinks once and for all?",
