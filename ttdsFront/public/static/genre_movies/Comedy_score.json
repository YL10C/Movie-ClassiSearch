After all, if the money of the public comes to the public then what is wrong. The plan of the five was successful and they managed to steal. But luck had something else approved.It seems that the number 8 is not a fate of his fate. The Prime Minister's announcement of demonetisation on November 8 at 8:00 pm changed all the fortunes. The money for which they were running back till today is trying to go far away from the same money today. It did not take so much effort to loot it, as it now took to hide it. It is so strange that if there is no money, there is trouble and if there is trouble. Where would the stolen money go after all this money was scrapped in demonetisation. One side leader fell behind them, and the other side luck did not take the name of ending the problems of theft on them, so the five together started saving lives. They began to start putting the stolen money at the right place. In the midst of bad luck, the five managed to get the money right, but the money does not reach the five. One of the friends who was orphan, would have deposited these money in orphanage house and some money reaches everyone but this part of the race behind the money has taught everyone a lesson that the money is necessary for life but not so much that one loses ones happiness behind it. The real purpose of life is a happier life.",
